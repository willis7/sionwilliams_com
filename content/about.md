## Bio

Hi, I’m Sion (pronounced the same as Sean), and I’ve been immersed in the world of software engineering for over 20 years, even before formal education honed my skills. My career has been defined by a passion for solving complex challenges and driving meaningful change in organizations through innovative technology solutions.

### Current Role

I’m currently an Engineering Director at ManyPets insurance, where I lead the Subscription Product area along with our Platform and Enablement teams. My role is focused on enabling the company’s sustainable growth as we transition from a startup to a scaleup. This involves:

- Identifying inefficiencies in processes and implementing innovative solutions.
- Leading the modernization of our data platform to deliver near real-time insights.
- Establishing an MLOps platform to support our AI strategy and enhance decision-making capabilities.

By addressing these challenges, I’ve been able to contribute to ManyPets’ mission of becoming a tech-forward, customer-centric insurance provider.

### Previous Experience

Before joining ManyPets, I was the Head of Engineering at Liverpool Victoria (LV=), the UK’s largest insurance company. In this role, I tackled significant challenges:

- Reorganized the engineering departments to navigate economic downturns effectively.
- Positioned LV= as an innovative tech leader in the insurance space.
- Led the creation of a highly secure and resilient cloud environment in just six months, serving as an exit strategy from legacy infrastructure.

Before this, I served as Head of Platform Engineering, where I was responsible for designing and implementing scalable, secure, and efficient systems to support the company’s growth.

### Earlier Career

My earlier career involved numerous contracting and consulting roles, where I helped organizations mature their development and software delivery practices. Highlights include:

- Consulting for one of the world’s largest banks to enhance their software engineering capabilities.

Providing strategic guidance to organizations transitioning to modern development practices and infrastructures.

### Personal Approach

Throughout my career, I’ve maintained a focus on delivering value by fostering collaboration, driving innovation, and continuously seeking ways to improve. Whether it’s through modernizing platforms, streamlining processes, or mentoring teams, I’m committed to creating lasting, positive impacts in the organizations I work with.
