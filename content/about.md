## Bio
Hi and welcome to my blog space. NOoo, I'm not a knife wielding maniac most of the time, that photo was from a wedding where I was the designated carver. More commonly I'm a freelance Principal DevOps Engineer with experience in the financial, public and banking sector. I specialise in digital transformation and cloud readiness. I take a lot of pride in evaluating company technology value streams and improving them in order to reach higher throughput and better quality.
