Yup, I have a highlighting system.

I spend a lot of time on my personal knowledge management (PKM) system, and over the years I have developed tools and systems to improve it. One of those is my highlighting system.  
I use the [Zebra Soft Brush Mildliner](https://amzn.to/3rN4mhq) set and they come in packs of 5. 

Colour System:  
- Pink - Idea
  - Reading something has triggered an idea. My first step is capturing the idea in LogSeq then I look for connected ideas.
- Yellow - Key Quote  
  - Any sentence or paragraph that I wish to reference at a later date.
- Orange - Something I don't know  
  - Prompt to revisit and research a topic.
- Blue - Action
  - Reading has triggered a need to do something e.g. the writer says bitcoin will be worth Â£30m in 2030, so I might go and buy some bitcoin.
- Green - Person of interest
  - This is the cause of my reading list being so long. If an author references another author who is an expert in a field I'm interested in, I will use this as a prompt to research them.
