Once upon a time, on the eve of Christmas, two insurance companies were preparing for the holidays. The first company was a grumpy old firm that had been around for 175 years. They didn't believe in using technology as a differentiator and had a toxic culture that made it difficult for employees to speak up or share their concerns. They were still using outdated processes like waterfall delivery, which made it difficult for them to keep up with the changing needs of their customers.

The second company was a young, hip firm that believed in using the best technology and fostering a positive work environment. They were agile and innovative, always looking for ways to improve the customer experience. They valued their employees and encouraged them to share their ideas and concerns.

As the holiday season approached, the grumpy old insurance company was struggling to keep up with the demands of their customers. Their outdated processes and toxic culture had left them behind, and they were struggling to compete with the younger, more agile company.

On the other hand, the young, hip insurance company was thriving. Their focus on technology and employee well-being had allowed them to stay ahead of the curve and provide excellent service to their customers. They were having a great time at work and were excited to celebrate the holiday season with their coworkers.

As Christmas day approached, the grumpy old insurance company found themselves feeling left out and alone. They realized that their negative attitude and outdated practices had caused them to fall behind, and they began to regret not embracing change and technology like the younger company had.

On the other hand, the young, hip insurance company was filled with joy and celebration. They were grateful for their success and the opportunity to work in a positive, supportive environment. They knew that their focus on technology and their employees had been the key to their success, and they were excited to see what the future held.

In the end, the grumpy old insurance company learned that it was never too late to change and embrace new ideas. They made a resolution to start the new year with a positive attitude and a commitment to innovation and technology, hoping to catch up to the success of the young, hip insurance company. The end
